Credit Risk Analysis ML Project
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for 
credit risk analysis. The model leverages historical data on
borrowers and their creditworthiness to predict the 
likelihood of default or delinquency on loans. 
The purpose of this README file is to provide an overview 
of the project and guide you through the necessary steps to 
set up and run the code.

Project Overview
The goal of credit risk analysis is to assess the 
probability of borrowers defaulting on their loans. 
In this project, we employ machine learning techniques to 
build a predictive model that analyzes historical data to 
estimate credit risk. By using a wide range of features such
as borrower demographics, credit history, income, and 
employment information, the model aims to make accurate 
predictions on whether an applicant is likely to default or 
not.

Model Training
The model training process involves preparing the data, 
training the machine learning model, and saving it for 
later use. To train the model, follow these steps:
1. Import Libraries
2. Read The Data
3. Data Analysis
4. Filling null values
5. Finding X and y cols
6. MinMax Scaling
7. Train Test Split
8. Feature Reduction on Corr
9. Model Building
10. Data Visualzation
